You can use either just the date, or the time the post was published in a YEAR-MONTH-DAYTHH:MM:SS format. Obviously, the machine readable stuff will come in handy later, as the viewer can't see this stuff, but you will be able to have the browser read the timestamp to organize or find certain posts. -->

        <!-- The data tag allows you to assign machine readable info inside a tag. This can be accessed by Javascript for example. This stored data allows the Javascript to do things within the browser without the need for server-side database calls or Ajax code. The above code lets the Javascript know my name is Doran. -->

         <!-- So, inside the 'a' tag, you can specify if the link is meant to be a file for downloading (hence the "download" tag... please note that in the example above, I've not given it an actual file to download so this link doesn't work. If it were a .pdf or .gif, this would function.), and you can also list an address to ping for tracking usage. This is helpful if you're linking to a page that wants to keep track of such things. The above "trackpings" link is just such a page. -->

         <a href="http://andor1.github.io/images/for-real.gif" download>Click here to download!</a>
         <!-- See? now isn't that better?!?! This link actually forces the download to happen! -->

         <br>

         <p>Did you know that you can force the browser to not translate selected <span translate="no">la mierda</span>?</p>
         <!-- So, yeah. Default on all text in the content window would be translate="true", so that the browser would automatically translate into, say, English for me, since that's my language. This can be helpful so that if you've got a proper name or something, and you don't want some translation to screw up a specific name or something along those lines. -->

         <br>

         <p> Listen up motherfuckers, all I got in my pockets is <span contenteditable="true">lint</span></p>
         <!-- Yeah, it's just friggin' link.

         ...Default on this tag is always "false", but if you change contenteditable to "true", users can type in whatever text they want on your site. -->

         <p> Spellcheck this, <span spellcheck="false">motherfathers!</span></p>
         <!-- ...and with one fell swoop, you can make it so the browser can't spellcheck that text in the span. I'm sure it's got a purpose. -->
